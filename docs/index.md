### Abandoned but not forgotten: New York’s once-booming oil industry and the wells it left behind

*Western New York towns were built around oil production. Now, they grapple with abandoned wells — the remnants of an industry in decline.*

When Paul Plants and his business partner started their oil company in 1970, they never expected to profit from the fossil fuel industry’s decline. “It’s an industry that is — was — very important,” Plants said. “I’m very proud of our involvement in it.” 

Plants’ father had worked in oil, and Plants himself, now 84, started his own drilling company in New York and Pennsylvania, the historic seats of oil drilling in the U.S.

Faced with both declining output and shifting opinions on oil and gas in New York, roughly four decades later, Plants needed to pivot. Instead of drilling for oil, the Plants and Goodwin Oil Company began filling abandoned oil wells throughout the northeast. 

Plants’ son and grandson took over the business and continue that work today. “The vast majority of the work that we do is plugging and abandonment of wells,” Steve said. 

Allegany County, the former seat of oil production in New York State, now has more abandoned and unplugged wells than active wells. Left open and unchecked, [unplugged wells can cause air pollution, contaminate water and release greenhouse gas](https://www.edf.org/orphanwellmap). Plugging documented and undocumented abandoned wells could cost over a billion dollars. But oil companies and environmental advocates alike say state resources have already fallen short.

Though states like Texas and New Mexico are the modern hubs for U.S. domestic drilling,  western New York is home to some of the country’s first oil wells. At its peak in 1882, New York State produced [6.7 million barrels of oil](https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/materials_minerals_pdf/dgeisv1ch4.pdf), more than 6 million of which came from a single county: Allegany.
